  # This determines whether metadata is sent in requests to the custom provider.
  #  - `off` will not send any metadata. payload will look like `{ messages }`
  #  - `variable` will send `assistant.metadata` as a variable on the payload.
  #  payload will look like `{ messages, metadata }`
  #  - `destructured` will send `assistant.metadata` fields directly on the payload.
  #  payload will look like `{ messages, ...metadata }`
  #  Further, `variable` and `destructured` will send `call`, `phoneNumber`, and
  #  `customer` objects in the payload.
  #  Default is `variable`.
